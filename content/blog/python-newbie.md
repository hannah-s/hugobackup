That's my 'before' post. There will be an 'after' post, eventually.

A couple of weeks ago, I've enrolled to Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, commonly referred to as [MITxÂ 6.00.1x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-9). 

The concept behind EDX is fairly simple: you get to pick from a vast catalogue of courses, offered by the most renowned universities in the world, and audit them for free. Alternatively, you can splurge a mere $50 USD for a certificate of completion. You need to pass an exam and complete some exercises to qualify for the cert, of course. 

I've a few IT vendor certs under my belt already (LPIC 1, RHCE and a couple of others), and I've always wanted to learn how to python, so I thought it'd be interesting to do it a bit differently this time. The course isn't as practical as it is academic - the focus is to teach the way of thinking behind CS. I started a [reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/5mxhub/anyone_finished_the_edx_python_course_by_mit_im/) on /r/learnpython, and the reviews were by and large positive, while confirming it can be intensive - especially compared to the more simplified [codecademy.com](https://codecademy.com). 

We're up to week 2, and I can confirm that it's a challenging one: even with some prior coding experience, the cogs in your brain must spin a bit in order to interpret a series nested while and for loops. I opted in for the cert, knowing it'd encourage me to complete the course rather than quit. To be continued, I suppose.

This is the ad for the course:
