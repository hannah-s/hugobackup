I got into IT about 4 years ago. 

I currently work as a Linux (and other *nix) sysadmin, for an Australian ISP. 

More about work stuff on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-shalev-61a61087).

## What's this CMS?

Not an actual CMS - [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) is a static site engine written in Go.

It's a big faster than it's biggest competitor, Jekyll, and is growing fast according to [staticgen](https://www.staticgen.com/).

There's no database in the backend - just HTML5 pages, which means it can run on an S3 instance at a very low cost.

Hugo makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

* [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
* [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
* [J Walter Weatherman](https://github.com/spf13/jWalterWeatherman)
* [Cast](https://github.com/spf13/cast)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/spf13).


## Some fun facts about Hugo:

* Built in [Go](http://golang.org/)
* Loosely inspired by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* Primarily developed by [spf13](http://spf13.com/) on the train while commuting to and from Manhattan.
* Coded in [Vim](http://vim.org) using [spf13-vim](http://vim.spf13.com/)


Thanks for reading.
